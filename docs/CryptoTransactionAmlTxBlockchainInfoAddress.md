## Methods

### NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress

`func NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress() *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress`

NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress instantiates a new CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddressWithDefaults

`func NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddressWithDefaults() *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress`

NewCryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddressWithDefaults instantiates a new CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetHasSent

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) GetHasSent() bool`

GetHasSent returns the HasSent field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetHasSentOk

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) GetHasSentOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetHasSentOk returns a tuple with the HasSent field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetHasSent

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) SetHasSent(v bool)`

SetHasSent sets HasSent field to given value.

### HasHasSent

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) HasHasSent() bool`

HasHasSent returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetHasReceived

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) GetHasReceived() bool`

GetHasReceived returns the HasReceived field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetHasReceivedOk

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) GetHasReceivedOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetHasReceivedOk returns a tuple with the HasReceived field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetHasReceived

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) SetHasReceived(v bool)`

SetHasReceived sets HasReceived field to given value.

### HasHasReceived

`func (o *CryptoTransactionAmlTxBlockchainInfoAddress) HasHasReceived() bool`
